				<h5>Distance and the Impact of "Gravity" Help Explain Patterns of International Trade</h5>
				<h6>
		United States trade with other countries declined dramatically during the recent recession, with the volumes of imports and exports each falling about 21 percent from third quarter 2008 to second quarter 2009. By comparison, real gross domestic product (GDP) contracted only 4 percent. A subsequent rebound in international trade flows is just as striking and has been one of the most robust indicators during the accelerating recovery.International trade flows are typically among the most volatile economic variables over the business cycle, fluctuating far more than GDP.<br>[1] This volatility represents a large degree of quarter-to-quarter variation in the amount of income that consumers and firms (both in the U.S. and abroad) spend on foreign goods relative to domestically produced ones. <br>
		However, the geographic distribution of trade between the U.S. and the rest of the world is, by contrast, remarkably stable over short time horizons. The fractions of goods the U.S. imports from individual countries or regions change slowly, and the movements in these fractions over the business cycle are relatively small. For example, China’s share of U.S. imports rose to 19 percent from 6 percent over the 15-year period from 1995 to 2010, though this figure changed by no more than about 4 percentage points during any single year, and typically much less.<br>One broad explanation is that this pattern of trade is determined by factors that are permanent, or at least slow to change, as well as by factors that vary over the business cycle.
